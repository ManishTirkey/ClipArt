# Fix for "Update check failed" Error

## Problem
The "Check for updates" feature in the tray menu shows the error: "Update check failed, Could not check for updates. Please try again later."

## Root Cause
The issue occurs because the `latest.yml` file is not uploaded to the GitHub release. Electron-updater requires this file to check for updates.

## Solution

### Option 1: Upload latest.yml using the provided scripts

1. **Set up GitHub authentication:**
   ```bash
   # Set your GitHub token (get one from https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   $env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_github_token_here"
   ```

2. **Upload the file using PowerShell:**
   ```bash
   npm run upload-latest-ps
   ```

   Or using Node.js:
   ```bash
   npm run upload-latest
   ```

### Option 2: Manual upload

1. Go to [GitHub Release v1.1.0](https://github.com/ManishTirkey/ClipArt/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
2. Click "Edit" on the release
3. Drag and drop the `release/latest.yml` file
4. Click "Update release"

### Option 3: Rebuild and publish

If you want to create a new release with the latest.yml automatically included:

1. **Build the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dist
   ```

2. **Publish to GitHub (requires GitHub CLI):**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   gh release create v1.1.1 --latest
   ```

## What was fixed

1. **Syntax Error**: Fixed missing arrow function syntax in `checkForUpdatesManually()`
2. **Logic Error**: Improved the update check logic to properly handle different scenarios
3. **Error Handling**: Added better error messages and logging
4. **Feed URL**: Explicitly set the GitHub feed URL for electron-updater
5. **Upload Scripts**: Created scripts to easily upload the latest.yml file

## Testing

After uploading the latest.yml file:

1. Run the app: `npm start`
2. Right-click the tray icon
3. Click "Check for updates"
4. You should see either:
   - "You are on the latest version" (if no updates available)
   - Update available dialog (if updates are available)

## Files Modified

- `src/main.ts` - Fixed update check logic and error handling
- `package.json` - Added upload scripts
- `scripts/upload-latest-yml.js` - Node.js upload script
- `scripts/upload-latest-yml.ps1` - PowerShell upload script

## Notes

- The app is currently at version 1.1.0, which matches the latest GitHub release
- The update checker will only show updates when a newer version is available
- All error messages now include more helpful details for debugging
